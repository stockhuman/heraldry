# Heraldry

This is a webapp and associated twitter bot that generates quasi-historically-accurate coat of arms with emojis as charges. Escutcheons (shields) and their divisions and tinctures are rendered in SVG, and the charges are blazoned with Twitter Emoji as an authoritative source.

## Contributing

Have an emoji you think you can blazon? Open an issue with your propsed Emoji and blazon combo - it doesn't need to follow the conventions set out [here](https://github.com/stockHuman/heraldry/blob/master/src/components/emoji.js): I can figure out the formatting.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and as such relevant commands and documentation can be found at github.com/facebook/create-react-app.

The Twitter bot was hosted on [glitch](https://glitch.com/~heraldry-bot). See relevant code there. The tweeted images are derived from the this branch.

## Acknowledgements
This project utilises Twemoji emojis, bundled into a TTF font using [Mozilla's software](https://github.com/mozilla/twemoji-colr).
