# Heraldry

This is a webapp and associated twitter bot that generates quasi-historically-accurate coat of arms with emojis as charges. Escutcheons (shields) and their divisions and tinctures are rendered in SVG, and the charges are blazoned with [Twemoji Emoji](https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font) as an authoritative source.

## Contributing

Have an emoji you think you can blazon? Open an issue with your propsed Emoji and blazon combo - it doesn't need to follow the conventions set out [here](https://github.com/stockHuman/heraldry/blob/master/src/components/emoji.js): I can figure out the formatting.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and as such relevant commands and documentation can be found at github.com/facebook/create-react-app.

The Twitter bot is hosted on [glitch](https://glitch.com/~heraldry-bot). See relevant code there. The tweeted images are derived from the `puppeteer` branch.

## Acknowledgements

This project utilises Twemoji emojis, bundled into a TTF font using [Mozilla's software](https://github.com/mozilla/twemoji-colr).
